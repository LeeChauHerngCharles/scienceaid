    <p>Atoms are made up of 3 subatomic particles. These particles are called protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons are packed tightly in the 
	center of the the atom, also known as the nucleus. The electrons of an atom orbit the nucleus.</p>

    <h3>Protons</h3>
    <p>Protons have a relative charge of +1 and their relative mass is 1. The number of protons in a atom defines the element.</p>
    </div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Neutrons</h3>
    <p>Neutrons have a relative charge of 0 and their relative mass is 1. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is represented by the nucleon number, 
	or more commonly known as the relative atomic mass.</p>
    </div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Electrons</h3>
    <p>Electrons have a relatice charge of -1 and their relative mass is 1/1840. As all atoms are electrically neutral, the number of electrons is similar to 
	the number of protons.</p>
