    <h3>Simple Covalent Structures</h3>
    <p>In simple covalent structures, the atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds. However, the molecules are held together by weak van deer Waals' forces. Van der Waals' forces are due to the temporary shift of electrons to a particular side of a molecule which causes slight positive and negative poles.</p>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Volatility</h3>
    <p>Simple covalent sructures have low boiling and melting points as the weak van der Waals' forces are easily broken.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Solubility</h3>
    <p>Most simple covalent structures are soluble in organic solvents but not in water. Examples of organic solvents are oil, petrol and turpentine. Organic solvents have at least one carbon atom. There are a few exceptions to this, such as alcohol and sugar, which are soluble in water.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Electrical Conductivity</h3>
    <p>Most covalent elements do not conduct electricity in any state as they lack delocalised electrons or free mobile ions.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Giant Molecular Structures</h3>
    <p>Allotropes are different forms of the same element. Diamond and graphite are allotropes are carbon. Silicon(IV) oxide is a giant molecular structure.</p>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Diamond</h3>
    <p>The carbon atoms in diamond are arranged in a tetrahedral shape. This accounts for its propertities as a hard substance. As the carbon atoms are held together by covalent bonds, it has a very high boiling and melting point.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Graphite</h3>
    <p>Carbon atoms in graphite are bonded in layers with 3 carbon atoms bonded to 1 carbon atom. The covalent bonds result in a large amount of energy required melt or boil it. The electron that remains unused enables graphite to conduct electricity. The layers of carbon in graphite are held together by weak van der Waals' forces. This accounts for it being soft and slippery. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Silicon (IV) oxide</h3>
    <p>Silicon(IV) oxide is a giant covalent structure. The ratio of oxygen to silicon atoms is 3:1, the atoms are arranged in a tetrahedral shape. This accounts for its propertities as a hard substance. As the atoms are held together by covalent bonds, it has a very high boiling and melting point.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Volatility</h3>
    <p>Most giant molecular structures have high melting and boiling points as the covalent bonds that hold them together require a large amount of energy to break.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Solubility</h3>
    <p>Giant molecular structures are insoluble in all solvents</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Electrical Conductivity</h3>
    <p>Giant molecular structures are non conductors of electricity except for graphite. This is as graphite has a electron that is not used for bonding. </p>
