    <h3>Solubility</h3>
    <p>Ionic compounds are usually soluble in water but not soluble in organic solvents. Examples of organic solvents are oil, petrol and turpentine.
	Organic solvents have at least one carbon atom. This is as the water molecules are attracted to the ions. This causes the electrostatic forces between the 
	ions to be weakened. As such, the ions are pulled away from one another.</p>

    <h3>Volatility</h3>
    <p>Most ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points. This is as the electrostatic forces of attraction are strong and require a lot of kinetic 
	energy to break. As such, a high amount of heat energy is required to break the bonds.</p>

    <h3>Electrical Conductivity</h3>
    <p>Ionic compounds can only conduct electricity when in molten or aqueous form. This is as the ions are mobile when they are in aqueous or molten state 
	and can conduct electricity.</p>
