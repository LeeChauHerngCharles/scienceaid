    <p>Measurement is an important part of Physics. In Physics, we are especially concerned with what standards of reference are used and how accurate the measurements are.</p>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Physical Quantity</h3>
    <p>A physical quantity that can be measured. It consists a numerical magnitude and a unit. There are seven basic physical quantities, or base quantities. All other common physical quantities such as area, volume and speed are derived from these seven quantities. They are called derived quantities.</p></div>

    <h3>Prefixes for SI Units</h3>
    <p>Prefixes to SI units are used to express either very large or very small numerical values</p></div>
  </div>
<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Scalar</h3>
    <p>Scalar quantities are physical quantities that have magnitude only. (Length, area, volume, speed, mass, density, pressure, temperature etc.)</p></div>
<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Vector</h3>
    <p>Vector quantities are physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction. (Displacement, direction, velocity, acceleration, force, weight etc.)</p></div>
