    <p>Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a solution of higher water potential to a solution of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane</p>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Permeable Membrane</h3>
    <p>A permeable membrane allows both the solvent and the solutes to pass through it.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Partially Permeable membrane</h3>
    <p>Partially permeable membrane allows some substances to pass through but not others.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Water potential</h3>
    <p>Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water to move from one place to another. When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established, which causes osmosis.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Role of osmosis</h3>
    <p>The cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass thorugh. As a result, plant cells are highly affected by osmosis. </p>
    <p>When a plant cell is put in  a solution of higher water potential than the cell sap, the cell expands. As the cell wall is rigid, it prevents over-expansion of the cell, resulting in the plant cell bcoming swollen or turgid. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. <strong>The pressure exerted by the water on the cell wall is the turgor pressure</strong>.</p>
    <p>When a plant cell is immeresed in a solution of relatively less water potential, water will leave the cell by osmosis. As a result, the cell shrinks.<strong> The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is known as plasmolysis.</strong> A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with high water potential.</p>
    <p>Crenation is a process by which animal cells lose their water when placed in a solution of low water potential. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a hypertonic solution.</p>

	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Role of turgor in plants</h3>
    <p>Turgor plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For instance:</p>
    <p>Certain flowers open during the day and close at night, while some flowers close during the day and open at night. In these cases, the bending movement of the petals is due to the changes in turgidity of the cells on the opposite surfaces of the petals.</p>
    <p>The leaflets of the Mimosa plant fold when they are touched. This is due to changes in the turgor of cells that make up small swellings at the base of the leaflets.</p>
    <p>Changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata.</p>
