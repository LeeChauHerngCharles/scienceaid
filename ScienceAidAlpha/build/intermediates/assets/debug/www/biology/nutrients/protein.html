    <p>Proteins are very complex organic substances made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Proteins are always present in protoplasm. Their molecules are the largest and most complicated of all substances.</p>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Amino acids</h3>
    <p>Every protein molecule is built up from simpler compounds known as amino acids. An amino acid is made up of an amino group, an acidic group and a side chain,</p>
</div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Polypeptides</h3>
    <p>Two amino acids may link up in a condensation reaction. The bond formed between the two amino acids is strong and called a peptide bond. Many aminoacids linked up by peptide bonds a polypeptide or peptone. Number of peptones linked together forms a protein.</p>

	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Functions of Proteins</h3>
    <p>Proteins are used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the synthesis of new protoplasm, for growth and  repair of worn-out body cells</li>
      <li>In the synthesis of enzymes and some hormones</li>
      <li>In the formation of antibodies to combat diseases</li>
    </ul>

    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Protein deficiency</h3>
    <p>Children who do not get enough protein may end up with a protein deficiency diesease called kwashhiorkor. Such children usually have swollen stomachs. Their skins crack and become scaly.</p>
