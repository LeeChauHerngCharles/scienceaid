    <p>There are many different types of cells in living organsisms. These cells differ in size and shape and they  perform specific functions.</p>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Differentiation</h3>
    <p>It is the process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Tissue</h3>
    <p>A tissue is a group of similar cells which work together to perform a specific function. Cells of the same type form a simple tissue. Tissues containing different types of cells are called complex tissues</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Simple tissue in animals - Examples</h3>
    <p>The epithelial tissue, or the epithelium, is a sheet of cells which covers both the internal and external surfaces of the body. The sheet of cells covering the external surface of the body is called the epidermis. The muscle tissue is a collection of muscle cells which helps your body to move by contracting.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Simple tissues in plants - Examples</h3>
    <p>The leaves and stems have covering tissues called the epidermis.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Complex tissues in animals - Examples</h3>
    <p>The tissue found inside an organ or between organs is called connective tissue. It consists of a few types of cells. However the whole tissue has one function: to connect the different parts of an organ or organs together. Other examples of tissues in animals are nervous tissue, glandular tissue and bone tissue.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Complex tissues in plants - Examples</h3>
    <p>An example of complex plant tissue is vascular tissue, made up of xylem tissue and phloem tissue.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Organs</h3>
    <p>An organ is a structure made up of different tissues working together to perform a specific function.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Organs in animals - Examples</h3>
    <p>The stomach is an organ whose function is to temporarily store food, digest and churn it.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Organs in plants - Examples</h3>
    <p>A leaf is an organ for phtotsynthesis. It contains palisade tissue, spongy mesophyll tissue, xylem tissue and phloem tissue.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Organ systems</h3>
    <p>Several organs working together make up an organ system, such as the digestive system and the respiratory system. Various system work together to make up the entire organism.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Classification</h3>
    <p>Biologists group living organisms according to their similarities and differences. This is called classification.</p>
