  <!-- /header -->
  
  
    <p>Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest units that have all the characteristics of life.</p>
	
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Studying parts of the cell</h3>
    <p>Light and electron microscopes are used to see cells and their parts. Light microscopes magnify objects upto 1000x, while electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200,000x.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Composition of a cell</h3>
    <p>Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm, which is essentially a jelly-like substance made of 70% of water. Protoplasm contains many other substances, most of which are proteins, carbohydrates and fats. The composition of protoplasm differs from each type of cell. The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts; the cell surface membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Cell surface membrane</h3>
    <p>The cell surface membrane or the plasma membrane is a partially permeable membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm. It controls substances entering or leaving the cell. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Cytoplasm</h3>
    <p>The cytoplasm is the part of protoplasm between the cell surface membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains enzymes and specialised structures called organelles. Organelles carry out various functions in the cell.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Nucleus</h3>
    <p>The nucleus consists of a small round mass of denser protoplasm called nucleoplasm, surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts. It is essential for cell division.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Cell wall</h3>
    <p>A plant cell has a non-living cell wall that encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell surface membrane. It is made up of cellulose and protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permemable. It is absent in animal cells.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Chromatin</h3>
    <p>It is a network of long thread-like structures found withing the nucleus. It controls the activities of the cell, such as cell division. Each chromatin thread is made up of proteins and a compound called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Hereditary information is stored in DNA. DNA also contains instructions that a cell needs for carrying out all the chemical reactions within itself. When the cell is dividing, the chromatin threads condense and become highly coiled rod shaped structures called chromosomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
    <p>Endoplasmic reticulum or ER is a membrane network in the cytoplasm. There are two types of ER: Rough ER and Smooth ER.</p>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
    <p>Rough ER has a surface that appears rough when viewed under elctron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface. The outer surface of RER is continuous with the nuclear envelope.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Ribosomes</h3>
    <p>Ribosomes are small round structures. Thery are either attached to the membrane of the RER or lie freely in the cytoplasm. They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell. The ribosomes attached to RER make proteins that are usually transported out of the cell. The ribosomes lying freely in the cytoplasm make proteins that are used within the cytoplasm of that cell.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
    <p>Smooth ER does not have ribosomes attached to its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER. It is connected to the RER. SER synthesises substances such as fats and steroids and converts harmful substances into harmless materials, which is called detoxification.</p>
    </div>
	</div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Golgi apparatus</h3>
    <p>The Golgi apparatus is shaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattened spaces surrounded by membranes. Vescicles can be seen fusing with one side of the Golgi apparatus and pinching off from the opposite side. Golgi apparatus stores and modifies substances made by the ER and packages these substances in vesicles for secretion out of the cell.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Mitochondria</h3>
    <p>Mitochondria are small sausage-shaped organelles. Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substances are mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substance4s are oxidised to release energy. This energy may be used the cell to perform cell activities  such as growth and reproduction.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Chloroplasts</h3>
    <p>Chloroplasts are oval structures found in plant cells. They contain a green a green pigment called chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make food.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Vacuole</h3>
    <p>A vacuole is a fluid-filled space enclosed by a  membrane. Vacuoles store substances within the cell. Animal cells may have many small vacuoles that contain water and food substances. These vacuoles usually exist temporarily. Plant ceolls usually have a large central vacuole which contains a liquid called cell sap. Cell sap contains dissolved substances such as sugars, mineral salts and aminoacids. This large vacuole is enclosed by a membrane called the tonoplast.</p>
