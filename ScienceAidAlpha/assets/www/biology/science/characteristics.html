  <div data-role="content" data-ajax="false"><h1>Characteristics of Life</h1> <hr />
  <!-- /header -->
  
  
    <p>Observations and experimentations have shown that all living organisms carry out certain activities. These activities are characteristics of living organisms, or in other words, these activities are the characterisitcs specific to life.</p>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Cells</h3>
    <p>All organisms are made up of simple units called cells. The cells of an organism carry out activities necessary for the organism to stay alive. For example, leaf cells in plants carry out photosynthesis.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Nutrition is the process by which organisms take in food and convert it into new protoplasm. Organisms gain the energy and materials they need from their food.</p>
    </div>
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Photosynthesis</h3>
    <p>Plants take in raw materials to make their own food through photosynthesis. Animals feed on plants or on other animals in order to survive, grow and carry out their daily activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Respiration</h3>
    <p>Living organisms gain energy through the process of respiration. Respiration is the oxidation of food substances to release energy for cell activities. Energy stored in organic food substances is set free when they break down through respiration into carbon dioxide and water.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Metabolism</h3>
    <p>Metabolism is the sum of all the biochemical reaction that take place within the cell. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Excretion</h3>
    <p>The process by which the organism removes metabolic waste products is called excretion. The substances that are to be removed are called excretory products.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Homeostasis</h3>
    <p>Cells require a constant chemical and physical environment in order to carry the maintenance of a constant internal environment is known as homeostasis.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Growth and development</h3>
    <p>Growth is a permanent increase in the mass and volume of an organism when absorbed food is converted into living matter. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>The movement of organisms is independent of external forces such as wind or water currents. Movement which includes moving from one place to another is termed locomotion.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p>Reproduction is a characterisitic of all living organisms, in which genetic information is passed on from parents to their offspring. Reproduction is necessary for a species to survive. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Sensitivity</h3>
    <p>Animals and plants are sensitive to changes in their environment and often react to these changes in ways which are beneficial to themselves. A change in the environment or an external influence causes the organisms to react in a predictable way.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Adaptability</h3>
    <p>All living organisms are able to adjust and adapt to changes in their environment. An adaptation is any characteristic of an organism that improves its chances of surviving in its environment. It improves chances of survival, support reproduction and the rearing of an offspring.</p>
