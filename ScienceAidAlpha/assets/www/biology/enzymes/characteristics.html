  <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Speeding up chemical reactions</h3>
    <p>Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.</p>
</div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Requirement in minute amounts</h3>
    <p>As enzymes remain unchanged in the reaction they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of enzyme can catalyse a large number of chemical reactions.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Specificity</h3>
    <p>Enzymes are highly specific in their action. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by  a unique enzyme.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Lock and key hypothesis</h3>
    <p>According to the lock and key hypothesis, enzyme reaction depends on the presence of active sites. Active sites are depressions or pockets on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) can fit. The substance binds to the enzyme, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Effect of temperature on enzymes</h3>
    <p>Enzymes have an optimum temperature. This is the temperature at which the enzyme is most active, catalysing the largest number of reactions per second.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Denaturation</h3>
    <p>Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a"><h3>Effect of pH on enzymes</h3>
    <p>Enzymes are affected by acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in slightly acidic conditions, while others require slightly alkaline solutions. </p>
