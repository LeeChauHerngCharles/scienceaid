  <div data-role="content" data-ajax="false">
    <p>Carbohydrates are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2:1</p>

    <h3>Sugars</h3>
    <p>Sugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Simple sugars</h3>
    <p>Single sugars or monosaccharides are small molecules. They cannot be further digested into smaller molecules. They can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells. The common single sugars are glucose, fructose and galactose. </p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Double sugars</h3>
    <p>Double sugars or disaccharides are so called because each molecule of a double sugar is made up of two molecules of single sugars bonded together. Common disaccharides are maltose, sucrose and lactose.</p>
    <p><strong>Maltose</strong></p>
    <p>Maltose occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Complex carbohydrates</h3>
    <p>A complex carbohydrate or polysaccharide consists of many monosaccharide molecules joined together. Polysaccharides are produced by the condensation of many similar molecules to form a long molecules. Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates.</p>
</div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Condensation reaction</h3>
    <p>A condensation reaction is a chemical reaction in whcih two simple molecules are joined together to form a larger molecule with the removal of one molecule of water.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Hydrolysis</h3>
    <p>Hydrolysis or a hydrolytic reaction is a reaction in which a water molecule is needed to break up a complex molecule into smaller molecules.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose</h3>
    <p>Plants store glucose in the form of starch, and animals store them in the form of glycogen, as they are insoluble in water, they are large molecules which diffuse through cell membranes so they will not be lost from the cell, can be easily hydrolysed to glucose when needed, they have compact shapes.</p>
    </div><div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false" data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Hydrolysis of starch</h3>
    <p>Starch in the foods we eat may be hydrolysed or digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is hydrolysed, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released. The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase annot hydrolyse maltose to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase.</p>

    <h3>Functions of carbohydrates      </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for  cell activities </li>
        <li>To  form supporting structures</li>
        <li>To  be converted to other organic compounds such as aminoacids and fats</li>
        <li>For  the formation of nucleic acids</li>
        <li>To  synthesise lubricants</li>
        <li>To  synthesise the nectar in some flowers    </li>
