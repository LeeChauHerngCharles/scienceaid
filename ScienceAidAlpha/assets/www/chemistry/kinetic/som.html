   <p>There are 3 states of Matter. Solid, Liquid and Gas.</p>
   <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
   <h3>Solids</h3>
   <p>Solids have a fixed shape and volume. The particles in the solid state are closely packed together in a orderly manner. They have very 
   strong forces of attraction. They only have enough kinetic energy to vibrate and rotate about their fixed postitions.</p>
   </div>
   <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
   <h3>Liquids</h3>
   <p>Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape. The particles in the liquid state are arranged in a disoderly manner and have weaker forces of 
   attraction than solids. They have more kinetic energy than solids and are not held in fixed postitions.</p>
   </div>
   <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
   <h3>Gases</h3>
   <p>Gases have no fixed shape and volume. The particles in the gaseous state are spread far apart and have weak forces of attraction. The particles have high 
   kinetic energy and move at very high speeds.</p>
