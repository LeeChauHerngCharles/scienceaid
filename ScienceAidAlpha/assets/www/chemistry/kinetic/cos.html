    <h3>Melting</h3>
    <p>When a substance changes from a solid to a liquid, the process is called melting. As the particles are heated, it gains kinetic energy. 
	The particles move faster and are able overcome the forces of attraction. The particles are then able to slide over one another.</p>

    <h3>Freezing</h3>
    <p>When a substance changes from a liquid to a solid, the process is called freezing. As the particles are cooled, it loses kinetic energy. 
	The particles move slower and are unable overcome the forces of attraction. The particles then go closer to each other until they are arranged in 
	a orderly manner.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Boiling</h3>
    <p>When a substance changes from a liquid to a gas, the process is called boiling. As the particles are heated, it gains kinetic energy. 
	The particles move faster and are able to overcome the forces of attraction. The particles move faster and are spread apart.</p>
    </div>
	 <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Evaporation</h3>
    <p>Evaporation is the process of a liquid state turning into a gas. Evaporation happens at any temperature. Evaporation only happens to the surface of 
	the liquid.</p>
    </div>
	 <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Condensation</h3>
    <p>When a substance changes from a gas to a liquid, the process is called condenstaion. As the particles cool down, it loses kinetic energy. 
	The particles move slower and are unable to overcome the forces of attraction. The particles get closer to each other until they are packed 
	closely to one another.</p>
    </div>
	 <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-corners="false"  data-content-theme="a">
    <h3>Sublimation</h3>
    <p>Sublimation occurs when particles in a solid have enough kinetic energy to overcome the forces of attraction and escape as a gas.</p>
